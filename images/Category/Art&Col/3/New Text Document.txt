Devils mask Ginidal Raaksha 5"(Sri Lankan traditional fire mask)

Product Description

A fire devil raksha (gini raksha, ginidal raksha) mask is a mask that Sri Lankans use a lot in festivals and cultural dances. Raksha means “demon” and the masks are apotropaic which means that it is intended to ward off evil. They are painted in vibrant colours, with bulging eyes and protruding tongues and they depict various types of demons. Raksha masks are the final aspect of the Kolam ritual, and they are a tribute to the Rakshasas, a race that earlier ruled Sri Lanka.
